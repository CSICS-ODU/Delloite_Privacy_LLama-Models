# Llama Models

Llama is an accessible, open large language model (LLM) designed for developers, researchers, and businesses to build, experiment, and responsibly scale their generative AI ideas. Part of a foundational system, it serves as a bedrock for innovation in the global community. A few key aspects:
1. **Open access**: Easy accessibility to cutting-edge large language models, fostering collaboration and advancements among developers, researchers, and organizations
2. **Broad ecosystem**: Llama models have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times, there are thousands of community projects built on Llama and platform support is broad from cloud providers to startups - the world is building with Llama!
3. **Trust & safety**: Llama models are part of a comprehensive approach to trust and safety, releasing models and tools that are designed to enable community collaboration and encourage the standardization of the development and usage of trust and safety tools for generative AI

Our mission is to empower individuals and industry through this opportunity while fostering an environment of discovery and ethical AI advancements. The model weights are licensed for researchers and commercial entities, upholding the principles of openness.

## Download

To download the model weights and tokenizer:

1. Visit the [Meta Llama website](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/).
2. Read and accept the license.
3. Once your request is approved you will receive a signed URL via email.
4. Install the [Llama CLI](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack): `pip install llama-stack`. (**<-- Start Here if you have received an email already.**)
5. Run `llama model list` to show the latest available models and determine the model ID you wish to download. **NOTE**:
If you want older versions of models, run `llama model list --show-all` to show all the available Llama models.

6. Run: `llama download --source meta --model-id CHOSEN_MODEL_ID`
7. Pass the URL provided when prompted to start the download.

Remember that the links expire after 24 hours and a certain amount of downloads. You can always re-request a link if you start seeing errors such as `403: Forbidden`.
